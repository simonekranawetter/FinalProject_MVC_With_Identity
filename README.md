# FinalProject_MVC_With_Identity
Final Project MVC with Identity, both parts for the EC Utbildning course on ASP.NET MVC

## Part 1
In this project you have to create a simple homepage with the help of ASP.NET Core MVC. 
You must use css libraries such as Bootstrap to make the site more attractive.
You must use the provided design to build the site.

- Must have navigation to be able to navigate between different sites such as home, services and contact us

- All forms must be validated. If the information entered isn't correct you must have a field that tells the user with the help of CSS. 

- Observe that the e-mail address must not contain special characters such as åäö


## Part 2

Building on part 1 you should add log in functionality (change the blue button in the navbar to a login button.) 
If the user isn't a member they should be able to click on a link on the login to get to a register form. After the user registered they should be logged in automatically. 

__For the passing grade__

- Register a user with info such as first name, last name, email, password and address info
- login with email and password
- see your profile what role you are logged in as
- Menu that has support-and social media should be changed to have a user specific menu (link to your own profile and log out)

__For the good grade__

- Full name should be visible in the user specific menu (as a clickable link to your profile)
- Change the info on your profile site and ability to add a profile picture
- An admin should have admin specific menu options to see and edit/delete users and add/edit or delete roles (not admin role)

## Additionally Implemented but not required

- Mock email service to submit both forms that can be easily set up to work with mailchimp or other services
- Custom RegEx for all validations
